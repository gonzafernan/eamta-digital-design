# EAMTA 2021 - Digital Design

The course aims to teach the basic concepts of digital design.

In the first part, the concepts of the HDL Verilog language are reviewed and the basic elements of digital design are presented: 
Combinational circuits and sequential circuits.

During the second part, the concepts of timing and gate and signal delays are addressed in order to understand how to properly design a digital circuit. 
The importance of a correct design is demonstrated, not only from the logic point of view, but also from the time domain, that is to make it work efficiently or, in our case, fast enough to satisfy the requirements of the application.

In the third part, a synchronous circuit will be simulated and implemented on an FPGA. 
During this process it will be verified that all constraints are met and finally its logic operation will be validated.

**Professors:** Dr. Ing. Ariel Pola (CognitionBI-Fundación Fulgor) and Eng. Federico G. Zacchigna (FIUBA)
